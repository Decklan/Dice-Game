# Dice-Game
A simple dice game I coded as part of a Javascript course I played around with.

GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he whishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 for either dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- If the player consecutively rolls two 6's, not on a single roll but across two rolls, then that player loses his entire
  global score and it's the next players turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his global score. 
  After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
