# Dice-Game using ES5 syntax but oh well
A simple dice game I coded as part of a Javascript course I played around with.

GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he/she wishes. Each result gets added to the player's ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 for either dice, all his/her ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- If the player consecutively rolls two 6's, not on a single roll but across two rolls, then that player loses their entire
  GLOBAL score and it's the next players turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score. 
  After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach the appropriate amount of points on their GLOBAL score wins the game
